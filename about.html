## About me

My name is Elie Tournier, I'm a French student in software engineering.
I contribute to Mesa3D by implementing a library of double precision operations in pure GLSL 1.30 for GPUs using bit twiddling operations and integer math.
This project is part of the Google Summer of Code.

When I'm not coding, you'll typically find me in mountain, riding my bike, climbing or skiing.
