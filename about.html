## About me

My name is Elie Tournier, I'm a French software engineer.<br>
Currently I work on the graphics stack, mostly on the mesa compiler.<br>
I started this contribution during the Google Summer of Code '16.<br>
Most of my code can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Hopetech).

When I'm not coding, you'll typically find me in mountain, riding my bike, climbing or skiing.
