Hi,

I create this blog in order to show you each steps of the implementation of a double precision floating point library.
This project take place with [Mesa](http://www.mesa3d.org/) for the [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/).
My GSoC proposal can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Hopetech/GSOC_Proposal).
